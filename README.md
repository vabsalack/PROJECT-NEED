# PROJECT-NEED

 - A Python GUI application called NEED for detecting and cropping the ROI of knee region from the low extremity X-ray of the body. 

 - Enable to recreate the environment by conda tools using NEED-env.txt file.

 - I included some pre-processing scripts under (data-preprocessing-scripts) dicrectory to filter out and crop the low extremity at ease.

 - The application run: gui/main/run.ipynb

 - I published the dataset which I used to train the YOLOv8 model on Kaggle platform, you can follow up the dataset by getting you helped by the following pics.

 - Demostration pics of the application attached below
